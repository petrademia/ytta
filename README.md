# YTTA - Yield-Tuned Tick-to-Trade Architecture

YTTA is a polyglot systems project exploring tick-to-trade architecture:
collect market/runtime signals quickly, decide quickly, and execute quickly.

## Implementations
- C++ (`cpp/`)
- Rust (`rust/`)
- Go (`go/`)
- Java (`java/`)

## Repository Layout
- `docs/` - architecture and design notes
- `specs/` - protocol and behavior specs
- `shared/` - shared config/schema artifacts
- `cpp/`, `rust/`, `go/`, `java/` - language-specific implementations

## Quick Start
Each language directory contains its own build/test instructions.
